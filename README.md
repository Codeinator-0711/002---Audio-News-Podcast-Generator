The file README.md represents the central entry point and your main contributions for the evaluation and examination of the given use case. This document needs to contain at least 10.000 characters, but not more than 100.000 characters.

Important: The number of characters in will be evaluated by automated processes and, if outside this range, will reduce the grading of the use case evaluation by 0,5 grades (from 1.0 best down to 6.0 worst). Hence, better count your characters...

For advice on how to write and format MarkDown files please visit (either or both):

The README.md file must be written in English language (expections on request only) and has to contain the following mandatory information in the following order:

At the very top of the file, a list of first name and last name followed by the matriculation number in squared brackets '[...]' for all students involved in and to be evaluated for the given use case. Other contributors must be listed without brackets and marticulation number. Sample: The following markdown code would create a valid output. Only Peter Parker and Precilla Presley will evaluted for the use case.

- Peter Peter [7436450]
- Precilla Presley [7442803]
- Bob the Bausmeister (supporting on GitHub Actions)
- Sharon Zurkoswsky
The title of the use case, exactly as defined by the lecturer (letter by letter) formatted as top level headline.Sample for valid markdown:

# B2B Customer Churn Analysis
Any subsequent text, images,tables, links, code fragments and anything else that explains/contains:

What was the task to be accomplished? What was intended to achieve? Sometime analytics projects fail or end up with the insight that the user problem can not be solved. This is also a valid and valuable result.

Description and your understanding of the business question or problem, analytical question and/or technical problem associated with the use case.

The methodological approach chosen to process and implement the use case.
For analytical uses cases it is wise to follow a structured approach like Microsoft's Team Database Science Process, which is the legitimate successor of the CrispDM methodology.

Most important: A detailed description of your approach, work, findings and concrete achievements towards the use case. Here you should accumulate the largest part of your writing.

A summary if the targets have been achieved, and if not - and whatever the reason is - why it wasn't achieved.
